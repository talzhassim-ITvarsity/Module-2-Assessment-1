                        <h3>TIGER</h3>
                        <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are known for their distinctive
                              orange fur with black stripes. They are apex predators and are found in a range of habitats,
                              from tropical rainforests to snowy tundras, across Asia. Tigers are solitary animals
                              and prefer to hunt alone, using their strength, agility, and stealth to ambush their prey.
                              They have sharp teeth and powerful jaws, which they use to kill their prey with a
                              single bite to the neck.</p>
                             <p>Tigers are highly endangered, and their populations have declined significantly
                              in recent years due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.
                              There are currently six subspecies of tigers, and all of them are classified as
                              endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN. Conservation efforts are underway
                              to protect these majestic animals, including the establishment of protected areas,
                              the enforcement of anti-poaching laws, and the development of community-based
                              conservation programs. There are also captive breeding programs in place to help
                              increase tiger populations, with the ultimate goal of reintroducing them into the wild.</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the tigers at pen E19.</p>
