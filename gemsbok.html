                        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                        <p>The gemsbok, also known as the southern oryx, is a large antelope species native to the
                              arid regions of Southern Africa. These animals have a striking appearance, with a long,
                              straight, spear-like pair of horns that can grow up to 85 cm (33 in) in length.
                              The horns are found in both males and females, although they are generally larger
                              and more heavily ridged in males. Gemsboks have a distinctive grayish-brown coat,
                              with a black and white face and striking black markings on their legs. They have adapted
                              to the harsh desert environment by having the ability to tolerate high temperatures
                              and go for long periods without water, obtaining most of their moisture from the vegetation
                              they eat.</p>
                             <p>Gemsboks are highly adaptable and can survive in a variety of different habitats,
                              from grasslands to rocky deserts. They are mainly grazers, feeding on tough desert vegetation,
                              although they will also browse on leaves and twigs when food is scarce.
                              Gemsboks are known for their incredible speed and agility, and are capable of running
                              at speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph). Despite their impressive horns and fierce appearance,
                              gemsboks are generally shy and solitary animals, although they may form small herds during
                              the dry season when food and water are scarce. These majestic animals are an iconic symbol
                              of the African savannah and a true testament to the beauty and adaptability of nature.</p>
