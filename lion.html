                        <h3>LION</h3>
                        <p>Lions are the most well-known and iconic members of the cat family, and they are one of
                              the most popular animals in the world. They are found in sub-Saharan Africa and a small
                              population in India, and they live in prides that consist of several females, their cubs,
                              and one or more males. Lions are apex predators and are known for their strength, speed,
                              and ferocity. They have muscular bodies, powerful jaws, and sharp teeth that enable them
                              to hunt a wide range of prey, including antelopes, zebras, and buffalo.</p>
                             <p>Lions are social animals that have a complex social structure, and they communicate
                              with each other through a range of vocalizations, including roars, growls, and snarls.
                              They are known for their distinctive manes, which are thicker and darker in males, and
                              they use their manes to intimidate rivals and attract mates. Unfortunately, lions are
                              classified as vulnerable by the IUCN, and their populations have declined significantly
                              in recent years due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation
                              efforts are underway to protect these majestic animals, including the establishment of
                              protected areas, the promotion of responsible tourism, and the development of
                              community-based conservation programs.</p>

                            <p>You will find the lions across the coffee shop.</p>
