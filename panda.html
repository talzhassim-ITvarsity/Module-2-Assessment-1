                        <h3>PANDA</h3>
                        <p>Pandas are a beloved species of bear that are native to China and are known for their
                              distinctive black and white fur. They are herbivorous animals that primarily feed on bamboo,
                              but they will also eat fruits, vegetables, and small rodents. Pandas have a unique digestive
                              system that is adapted to their bamboo diet, and they have large, powerful molars that enable
                              them to crush tough bamboo stems and leaves.</p>
                             <p>Pandas are solitary animals that prefer to spend most of their time in trees or sleeping
                              on the forest floor. They have a gentle disposition and are known for their playful and
                              curious nature. Unfortunately, pandas are classified as vulnerable by the IUCN, and their
                              populations have declined significantly due to habitat loss, poaching, and the effects of
                              climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these beloved animals,
                              including the establishment of protected areas, the promotion of sustainable development,
                              and the reintroduction of captive pandas into the wild.</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the pandas to the right of the insect house.</p>
