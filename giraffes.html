                        <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                        <p>Giraffes are one of the most iconic animals found in the African savannah,
                              known for their incredibly long necks and graceful movements.
                              These majestic creatures are the tallest land animals in the world,
                              with adult males standing up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) tall. Their long necks,
                              which can measure up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in length, contain only seven vertebrae,
                              just like humans, but each one is significantly larger. Giraffes have a distinctive
                              spotted pattern on their coats, with each individual having a unique pattern that is similar to a human fingerprint.
                              Giraffes are herbivores, and they have a highly specialized diet that consists
                              mainly of leaves, flowers, and buds from acacia and other tree species.
                              To reach the high branches, they use their long necks and powerful tongues
                              that can stretch up to 18 inches (45 centimeters) in length.
                              </p>
                             <p>Giraffes are social animals that live in herds, typically consisting of females
                              and their young, although males may join the herd during the breeding season.
                              They communicate with each other through a variety of sounds, including grunts,
                              moans, and hisses, as well as through body language such as head-butting and neck wrestling.
                              Despite their impressive size, giraffes are relatively peaceful creatures and have
                              few natural predators, although lions and crocodiles will sometimes prey on young or weak
                              individuals.</p>

                            <p>You will find the giraffes across mo's pizza.</p>
