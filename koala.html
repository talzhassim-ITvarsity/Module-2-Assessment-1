                        <h3>KOALA</h3>
                        <p>Koalas are iconic marsupials that are native to Australia, known for their distinctive
                              round ears, fuzzy appearance, and love of eucalyptus leaves. They are primarily nocturnal
                              animals that spend most of their day sleeping in the branches of eucalyptus trees.
                              Koalas are herbivores, and they have a highly specialized diet that consists almost
                              exclusively of eucalyptus leaves. To digest these tough, fibrous leaves,
                              koalas have a unique digestive system that allows them to break down the
                              toxic compounds found in eucalyptus leaves and extract the nutrients they need.</p>
                             <p>Koalas have a unique social structure, with males and females living in overlapping
                              territories that are defended by dominant males. They communicate with each other through
                              a range of vocalizations, including grunts, snores, and bellows, as well as through scent
                              marking and body language. Unfortunately, koalas are classified as vulnerable by the IUCN,
                              due to habitat destruction, climate change, and disease. Conservation efforts are underway
                              to protect these beloved animals, including the restoration of habitat, the establishment
                              of wildlife corridors, and the development of vaccines for koala diseases.</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the koalas at pen E3.</p>
