                        <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                        <p>Monkeys are a diverse group of primates found all around the world, from South America
                              to Asia and Africa. They come in many different sizes, ranging from the tiny pygmy marmoset,
                              which is smaller than a human hand, to the large and powerful mandrill, which can weigh up
                              to 120 pounds (54 kg). Monkeys are known for their intelligence, dexterity, and social behavior.
                              They are highly adaptable creatures that have evolved a wide range of behaviors and physical
                              adaptations to survive in different environments.</p>
                             <p>Monkeys are primarily arboreal animals, and they spend most of their time in trees.
                              They have opposable thumbs and toes, which enable them to grasp branches and climb with ease.
                              Many monkey species are also known for their vocalizations, which they use to communicate with
                              each other and establish social hierarchies. Some species, such as the vervet monkey,
                              have complex alarm calls that warn other members of their group about the presence of predators.
                              Unfortunately, many monkey populations are under threat due to habitat destruction, poaching,
                              and the pet trade. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these amazing animals and
                              their habitat, including the establishment of protected areas and the enforcement of wildlife laws.</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the monkeys next to the monkey trail.</p>
