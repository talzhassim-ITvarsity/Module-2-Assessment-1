                        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                        <p>Gorillas are the largest primates in the world, with adult males weighing up to 400 pounds (180 kg)
                              and standing up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall when upright. They have distinctive black fur and a muscular build,
                              with broad chests and arms that are longer than their legs. Gorillas are native to the dense forests of central
                              and eastern Africa, where they live in family groups led by a dominant male known as a silverback. Gorillas are
                              primarily herbivores, and they have a specialized diet that consists mainly of leaves, stems, and fruit.</p>
                             <p>Despite their size and strength, gorillas are generally peaceful animals that are known for their gentle
                              nature and complex social behavior. They are highly intelligent and have been observed using tools in the wild,
                              such as sticks to measure the depth of water or to extract insects from tree bark. Gorillas also have a rich
                              communication system that includes a wide range of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body postures.
                              Unfortunately, gorilla populations are under threat due to habitat destruction, poaching, and disease,
                              and they are classified as endangered by the IUCN. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these
                              magnificent animals and their habitat for future generations.</p>

                            <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E15.</p>
