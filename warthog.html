                        <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                        <p>Warthogs are medium-sized wild pigs that are found in a range of habitats across sub-Saharan Africa.
                              They have distinctive facial features, including warts on their faces, which give them their name.
                              Warthogs are primarily herbivores and feed on a variety of vegetation, including grasses, roots, and tubers.
                              They also use their snouts to dig for food and water in the dry African soil.
                        </p>
                             <p>Warthogs have a unique defense mechanism that they use when threatened by predators,
                              such as lions or hyenas. They will run away from the predator and then suddenly turn around
                              and charge at it, using their sharp tusks to defend themselves. Warthogs are also known
                              for their social behavior and will often form groups, known as sounders, consisting of several
                              females and their young. Males are usually solitary and will only join a sounder during
                              mating season.</p>
                           <p>Warthogs play an important role in the African ecosystem by creating burrows
                              and wallows that provide shelter and water for other animals. Despite their tough exterior,
                              warthogs are vulnerable to habitat loss and poaching, and their populations are declining
                              in some areas. Efforts are being made to protect these unique animals,
                              including the establishment of protected areas and the promotion of responsible
                              tourism practices.</p>
                           <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                            <p>You will find the warthogs near the lake.</p>
